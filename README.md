# NFL Tracker APP
Created By: Bruce Brown

## About

A C# WinForm application to display data for the current National Football League (NFL) season, teams, and players by using the API-AMERICAN-FOOTBALL (1.4.7) API from [API-SPORTS](https://v1.american-football.api-sports.io). The API key used is associated with the Mega plan tier option that allows up to 150,000 calls to the API each day, but a new developer would need to get their own key from API-Sports. There is an option to view a list of teams by division or conference, which allows the user to click on the team's image to get the teamâ€™s data. On the team form there is information about the team and a few stats, as well as buttons to get the current roster, schedule, or current game data. There is error handling for when the API returns and error and when there is no data available for a team or player selected. Datagridviews are used to display most of the data and statistics received from the API calls. There is a help menu that provides information to the user about how to use the different forms.

## API Key

The API Key is stored in the NFLKey.cs class, which is required for the application to run. That class variable is currently blank due to this project being on GitHub. I eventually plan to update this application to use a Key Vault to no longer have to house the key within the application.
